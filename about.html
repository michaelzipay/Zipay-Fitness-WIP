        <h1>Zipay Fitness is the Passion Project of Michael Zipay</h1>
        <p>Michael created Zipay Fitness in order to help with the less enjoyable parts
            of fitness. New lifters often quit lifting because they don't enjoy it. This
            reason is not "I don't want to get fit anymore." Zipay Fitness exists to 
            solve this problem. With Zipay Fitness, your training program will be 
            uniquely yours, curated based on your likes and dislikes. These will be 
            assessed based on a preliminary gym visit with the intention of trying the
            exercises you will be doing in the future. Ready to make the switch and get
            fit with Zip? Click the green button and get started now!
